# Chat-UOL - Live Chat Application 🗨️💬

**Chat-UOL** is a real-time live chat application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. It features both public and private messaging, with persistent chat history that stays intact even after a page refresh.

## Features ✨

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly in the chat. All messages are broadcast to all participants in real-time.
- **Private Messaging**: Send private messages to specific users without others seeing them.
- **Persistent Chat History**: Messages remain intact across sessions—even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all tablets, and mobiles.

## Technologies Used ⚙️

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling dynamic interactions and user events.
- **AJAX**: For making asynchronous requests to the server, enabling smooth communication without page reloads.
- **Axios**: For simplified HTTP requests, especially for interacting with the API.
- **API**: For real-time data exchange and managing message storage.

## How It Works 🔧

1. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - Using **AJAX** and **Axios**, the app makes asynchronous requests to the server, enabling real-time message updates for all users in the chat.
   
2. **Private Messaging**:
   - Users can send private messages to each other, which remain visible only to the recipient.
   
3. **Persistent Messages**:
   - The chat history is saved in a browser or server-side database, ensuring that previous messages are shown even after refreshing the page.
